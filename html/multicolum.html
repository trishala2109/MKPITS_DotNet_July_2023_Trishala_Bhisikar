        flower, Reproductive portion of any flowering plant (angiosperm). Popularly, the term applies especially when part
         or all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form. Flowers present a multitude of combinations 
         of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement. In some plants, individual flowers are very small and are borne
        in a distinctive cluster (inflorescence). Each flower consists of a floral axis that bears the essential organs
         of reproduction (male stamens and/or female pistils) and usually accessory organs (sepals and petals); the 
         latter may serve both to attract pollinating insects (see pollination) and to protect the essential organs.
         Flower parts are arrayed usually in whorls but sometimes spirally. Four distinct whorls are common: the outer
         calyx (sepals), the corolla (petals), the androecium (stamens), and, in the centre, the gynoecium (pistils).
         The sepals are usually greenish and often resemble reduced leaves; the petals are usually colourful and showy.
         Pollen is produced in the stamens. A pollen-receptive stigma rests atop each pistil. The pistil, made up of
         one or more carpels, encloses an ovary that contains the ovules, or potential seeds. After fertilization 
         the ovary enlarges to form the fruit. Flowers have been symbols of beauty in most civilizations of the
         world, and flower giving is still among the most popular of social amenities.
