        <p style="text-align: justify;">The claws of a tiger are believed to bring good luck, and the genitals are believed to be aphrodisiacs. 
            Tiger pelts are in great demand in the black market and so are their teeth and whiskers, which are said 
            to ‘ward off the evil eye’.<br>

            The Bengal Tiger is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 but despite the strong 
            level of protection granted by the law of the land, these big cats continue to fall prey to threats such as 
            jaw traps, snares, electrocution, poisoning and illegal wildlife trade. Our anti-poaching unit ‘ForestWatch’
             has assisted enforcement authorities in busting many poachers in the past resulting in the recovery of tiger
              skins, claws and other wildlife contraband from these traffickers.
