                             resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce
                             current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and 
                             terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate 
                             many watts of electrical power as heat may be used as part of motor controls, in power 
                             distribution systems, or as test loads for generators. Fixed resistors have resistances
                            that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors
                             can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as 
                             sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force, or chemical activity.
