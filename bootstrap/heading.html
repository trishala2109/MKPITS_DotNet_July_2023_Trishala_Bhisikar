            An essay can be one paragraph if you are asked to write a concise essay with one main idea,
             which is between 100 to 200 words or 10 to 14 sentences. In most cases, this is categorized as
              a short essay. It is an essay that bears a single argument and respective supporting ideas or
               pieces of evidence. As long as your single-paragraph essay can make sense to your readers, 
               it can fetch you good marks.
