            By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.
             Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is 
             "soft" because it is easy to change.<br>

            and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.
